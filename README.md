# Client-Side-Scripting-Complete-Web-Portfolio
This large file dump is the product of a "Client-Side Scripting for the Web" class in 
which every week we would have to make a website using a new concept. From HTML and CSS 
to Javascript, Angular and AJAX, this class covered a wide array of topics. Most of the 
database reliant projects will not work unless tunneled into my university's connection. 
Projects for best if run using Netbeans.
